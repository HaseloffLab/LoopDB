# Issues

Entries without any features have problems with highlighting in sequence viewer. This is the case for assemblies which are saved in database with no actual features annotated", but with parent and inherited relations (I think)...

Cannot shift rendering position of composite in angularplasmid without screwing up relative positioning of features for correct highlighling. Now it starts at origin in position 0 but all features appear sideways...
