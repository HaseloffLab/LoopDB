	Loop assembly is a recursive DNA assembly method based on standardised type IIS assembly and Unique Nucleotide Sequences (UNS). Loop uses the Common Syntax for DNA parts to allow composing transcriptional units from L0 parts - currently used by PhytoBricks, MoClo and GoldenBraid. Then, Loop assembly 'loops' between two levels (odd and even) to generate DNA constructs of arbitrary complexity, with each level increasing the assembled modules by a factor of four.

	LoopDesigner is the software layer of Loop assembly that rounds up all the knots, ties them and supplies a neat frontend for sequence handling and experimental design. You can design DNA constructs, perform <i>in silico</i> assembly and LoopDesigner will produce the necesary information for your experiments and also keep a database of parts you've created and assembled.
