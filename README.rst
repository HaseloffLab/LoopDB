Welcome to LoopDB
=================

LoopDB is a module for creating and storing DNA parts for Loop Assembly. It comes with a prebuilt
schema for implementing original Loop Assembly protocol, but is completely general and allows
alternative schema definitions ( see *manual-example* ).

For a quick introduction please read the `Getting started
<https://github.com/HaseloffLab/LoopDB/wiki/Getting-Started>`_
section. Have a look at the `Tables
<https://github.com/HaseloffLab/LoopDB/wiki/Tables>`_
section for a brief description of the underlying data structure. Check out example folders with
some code to get you started. You can clone just `examples` branch, without the sorce code by


::

    git clone -b examples git@github.com:HaseloffLab/LoopDB.git

Refer to **Advanced** for getting hold of **SQLAlchemy** functions.

**Any other questions?** Please file an issue, or contact me at m.delmans@gmail.com

Looking for LoopDesigner ?
==========================

It's on another `branch <https://github.com/HaseloffLab/LoopDB/tree/loopdesigner>`_.
