## Comments for DNALooper:

1-Add feature for adding concentrations to parts for streamlined reaction calculation.
2-Deleting of parts required for higher assemblies does not work (since it shouldn't) but no error message appears...
3-Renaming is important (otherwise its delete and then assemble again)
4-Page needs to be refreshed to perform a second assembly after performing one otherwise it does not work
5-Layout need some work, maybe parametric relationshipts with vector preview?
6-Info page about overhang type Prom5 (probably include some kind of diagram)
7-Single part submission dropbox does not seem to work for me
8-Part submission does not take into account the common syntax strictly. I.e. for CDS it includes AATG regardless if there is ATG.
9-Prepend level assembled into in name?
10-Folder should be name according to level and position. For Hybrids the highest level followed by *.
11-Home page upper window is empty. Should we include description and references?
12-Footer with contact info and license?
13-Cliking on directory name should also open up directory.
14-Sorting of categories and directory names? They tend to move around according to last assembly (entry) I think.
15-In assembly: automatic submit when selection is performed, not its submit submit submit.
16-Multiple part entry "change all" selection.
17-Include GB features for REs, Overhangs.
18-%iLike% type parameter fast selection for text inputed in selector fields for parts in assembly.

## Code changes
- Included direction (strand) in multi-part assemble, otherwise its defined as reverse if not designated
- Changed schema to allow for "spacer" nucleotides in all vector -> DIRTY HACK - Does not always work perfectly...
- Changed vectors and vector names
- Changed font for vector texts in CDS.
- Changed font sizing in vector text.
- Changed colour schemes (just a bit).
- Changed selector widths.
